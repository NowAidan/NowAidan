        <p>
            Atropa bella-donna has an exstenive history of use as a medicine, cosmetic, and poison.
            It was first known by various folk names, the most popular being "deadly nightshade".
            The modern day name for it was bestowed by Carl Linna (1707-1778).
            Atropa was chosen due to the poisonous properties of the plant.
            And bella-donna (meaning "beautiful woman" in Italian) to represent the plant being used for cosmetic purposes.
